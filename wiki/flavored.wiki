<section begin="intro" />Many historical [[companies]] are represented as flavored companies. The AI is more likely to establish a flavored company over a basic one. These companies are typically tied to specific [[state]]s or [[culture]]s. As such they are heavily associated with certain [[countries]], but those tied to states are not technically limited to specific countries as in theory any country can conquer any state.<section end="intro" /> These companies are organized here by the countries they are most commonly associated with.
<!-- Editor note: to add new labeled sections for transclusion, add <section begin="Name" /> to the end of the line above the included row(s) (before the |-) and <section end="Name" />to the end of the last included row; disconnected rows can be "merged" by using the same section name on separate table sections; be sure to add the new name to the list in Template:Company list/doc -->
== American companies ==
These companies are associated with states or countries in North and South America.
