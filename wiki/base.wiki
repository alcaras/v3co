{{Version|1.9}}{{Economynav}}
'''Companies''' represent particularly notable corporations or joint ventures. Each company is associated with one or several types of building in a country. The company can own and build levels of these buildings and provide bonuses to throughput and construction efficiency. Companies potentially provide additional national bonuses if the company is sufficiently productive.

Each country has a limited number of slots for companies. Slots are gained by researching certain [[society technologies]], starting with {{iconify|Corporate Charters|invention}}. Each Society technology directly following Corporate Charters adds {{green|+1}} additional company slot up to a maximum of 5 slots upon researching {{iconify|Macroeconomics|invention}}. An additional company slot can be unlocked by enacting {{iconify|Corporate State|law}} or from the [[power bloc]] principle {{Principle|Companies|III|1|w=24px}}.

Each company has certain requirements before it can be established, typically building a minimum level of one of its associated buildings. Flavored companies tend to have stricter requirements, such as constructing the requisite building in a specific state. Additionally, 5 levels of an associated building in one state must be available to transfer to the company's ownership. This can be from private owners, nationally-owned, or a mix of both.

When a company is established, it cannot be disbanded for five years. Similarly, after a company is disbanded, it cannot be reestablished for four years. Companies which own a country cannot be disbanded.

=== Company headquarter ===
Each company has an associated {{iconify|Company Headquarter|building}} building. This is an ownership building similar to {{iconify|Financial District|building}}s and {{iconify|Manor Houses|building}}, but associated specifically with a particular company. When a company is established, its headquarter is immediately built in a state, with higher weighting to states that have buildings associated with the company. The headquarter has as many levels as the company owns building levels; these are automatically added and removed. Company Headquarters have only a single production method – depending on the current law and power bloc principles, which have the effects listed below.

== Benefits ==
Buildings owned by an established company enjoy {{green|+20%}} throughput, and buildings constructed by a company have {{green|+50%}} construction efficiency. All countries also gain a scaled bonus based on their {{icon|prestige|3=1}} rank, calculated as <math>10 \cdot (1 - \tfrac{\text{rank}}{\text{num of countries}})</math>. For example, {{flag|Kongo}} starts at rank 185, around the {{hover box|including the 'unranked' decentralized nations|halfway point of all starting countries}}, and it has a starting prestige bonus of {{green|+5%}}. The top ten ranked countries always have {{green|+10%}}, as well as an additional {{green|+1%}} per rank up to {{green|+10%}} ({{green|+20%}} total) throughput and construction efficiency for the Rank #1 country.

The throughput bonus is scaled for a given building to the proportion of levels owned by companies. For example, a building with half of its levels owned by a company would receive {{green|+10%}} throughput – half of the base {{green|+20%}} throughput bonus – as well as half of the prestige bonus.

If a country has more established companies than slots, then each additional company adds a penalty to the throughput and construction efficiency bonuses, scaled to the overage ratio, with a minimum penalty of {{red|×0.33}}. For example, if a country has three companies but only two slots, it receives a <math>\tfrac{\text{companies}}{\text{slots}} -1=\tfrac{3}{2}-1=</math> {{red|×0.5}} multiplier or 50% of the normal company bonuses. This also applies to the prestige bonus.

The power bloc principle {{principle|Internal Trade|II|1}} provides {{green|+5%}} company throughput and the principle {{principle|Companies|I|1}} provides {{green|+10%}} company throughput . This is additive with the base throughput and prestige rank bonus.

=== Prosperity ===
Companies start with 0 prosperity. The current prosperity changes towards the target prosperity weekly by 0.2 to 1 depending on the number of fully employed building levels the company owns. With 20 or more fully employed levels, prosperity increases weekly by 1, and with 40 or more levels it decreases weekly by 0.2. These values scale down or up with fewer employed levels; for example, with only 10 fully employed levels, a company's prosperity would increase weekly by 0.6 or decrease by 0.8.

Target prosperity is set by a combination of company productivity, number of employed levels, and {{iconify|executive|role}} {{iconify|popularity|political}}. Productivity gives 50 times the companies relative productivity. This is equal to the average productivity of the companies owned building levels compared to the average productivity of all associated building levels not owned by the company. Each fully employed building level gives another 1, up to 50. Finally, each point of the executive's popularity gives 0.2, from -20 to 20. The maximum target cannot exceed 100, but it can be "buffered" if the total sum is over 100. For example, a company with a relative productivity of 1.5 (50% more productive than global average for its building types), with 10 employed levels and an executive with {{red|−10}} popularity would have a prosperity target of <math>(50 \cdot 1.5) + 10 + (0.2 \cdot -10) = 75 + 10 - 2 = 83</math>

When a company reaches 100 current prosperity, its prosperity bonus activates. If the company drops below 75 prosperity, its bonus deactivates. If a company is disbanded and later re-established, it starts with 0 prosperity again.

=== Prestige goods ===
{{expansion|cocb}}
Many companies can produce [[prestige goods]]. Companies producing flavored goods can do so immediately when prosperous, while companies producing generic goods require completing a journal entry first.

Company charters unlock additional features for that company. There are five types of charters. Charters cost {{red|100}} {{icon|authority|3=1}} each to maintain, unless the country has available ''free charters''. Countries have a base of 1 free charter<ref>Technically 0, but most Economic System laws give +1</ref>, with more gained as in the table on the right. Without {{DLC icon|Charters of Commerce|w=24px|1}}, only Trade Rights can be granted.
